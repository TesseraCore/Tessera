# Samples Directory

Place test images here for local development. All files in this directory are gitignored.

## Usage

The demo application will automatically try to load images from this directory when you click "Load Test Image". 
If no sample images are found, it will generate a test checkerboard pattern instead.

## Supported Formats

You can use any image format supported by Tessera:
- PNG, JPEG, WebP (standard formats)
- TIFF (with pyramid support)
- DICOM (medical imaging)
- IIIF manifests
- Zarr arrays

## Image Names

The demo will automatically discover all files in this directory (except .gitkeep).

## Example Sources

- **Test Images**: Use any sample images from your test suite
- **Medical Images**: DICOM samples from public datasets
- **Large Images**: Deep zoom test images (e.g., from OpenSeadragon examples)
